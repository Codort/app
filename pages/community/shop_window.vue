      description="Create an abstracted interface between your internal team, top developers, and outside contributors. Fed-up of bloated issue trackers and poor quality merge requests? Set-up a 'shop window' that unifies all your documentation, issue tracking, and more into a separated interface and let our AI agents quickly triage everything before it hits your internal tracker. Integrates with Jira, Trello, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Confluence, and more!"
