## üíû Together, we will make commercial open source easy

Codort is an all-in-one commercial open source software (COSS) project helping other COSS manage compliance and community.

## üîì Why open source?

We believe open core companies (companies that have most of their code freely available but a small subset proprietary) is the *only* future for software development, here's why:

1. Open source is already everywhere. Up to [99%](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/is-open-source-security-a-ticking-cyber-time-bomb/) of a company's proprietary codebase may comprise of open-source software. [90%](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230) of companies already depend on open-source software. In fact, open-source is so pervasive that if we wanted to replace all open-source code it would cost [$8,800,000,000,000](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230).
1. Generative AI is already devaluing proprietary software. Boilerplate code can be generated in seconds, an app's infrastructure has little-to-no value. The only value is your 'secret sauce', which could be a trademarked algorithm, proprietary data, an excellent marketing strategy, or something else, but it sure isn't your generic codebase! By making your code open source, you can immediately unlock the power of cheaper development, open source communities, and giving back to the open source developers you rely on.
1. As genAI gets cheaper, outsourcing code generation to international developers will be a thing of the past. Until we reach AGI (if ever), the creativity and innovation of the collective 'hive mind' will not be replaceable. This means that open-source communities will only grow in value. Whether that's [finding and squashing bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law), or suggesting and implementing new features, communities will keep software together.

## üî≠ Our 2035 vision

All new software companies will be open core.

1 out of 4 existing software companies will open source at least part of their codebase.

## ü¶∏ Why Codort?

Despite the increase in open-source software, it's still difficult to manage compliance and legal requirements.
Moreover, an increase in attacks from nation-state actors and even self-inflicted attacks from open-source maintainers, means that companies are more wary of their open-source dependencies.
New platforms are helping open-source consumers protect their software supply chain, but who is protecting the open-source producers?
Codort helps automate compliance and community management, making it easy to produce trustworthy commercial open source software with a vibrant community behind it.

## üß∞ Features

The features below are our (non-exhaustive) wishlist of products and features, some will happen, some won't, we'll be [lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development) about it. Also:

* We reserve the right to change what is paid/free *before* deployment;
* Once deployed we reserve the right to make any paid features free;
* Once deployed, we [pledge](https://github.com/Codort/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-mutual-benefits-of-open-source) to keep core (free) features always free and licenced under a permissive license - we won't rug pull!!!

Paid features will be available for free to non-profit open-source projects.
Codort will integrate with your preferred source code management (SCM) tool, starting with GitHub and GitLab.
