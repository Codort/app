# Codort

Codort is an all-in-one commercial open source software (OSS) project helping other OSS manage compliance and community.
Codort will integrate with your preferred source code management (SCM) tool, starting with GitHub and GitLab.

## üîì Why open source?

We believe open core companies (that is companies that have most of their code freely available but a small subset proprietary)  is the *only* future for software development, here's why:

1. Open source is already everywhere. Up to [99%](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/is-open-source-security-a-ticking-cyber-time-bomb/) of a company's proprietary codebase may in fact comprise of open-source software. [90%](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230) of company's already depend on open-source software. In fact, open-source is so pervasive that if we wanted to replace all open-source code it would cost [$8,800,000,000,000](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230).
1. Generative AI is already devaluing proprietary software. Boilerplate code can be generated in seconds, an apps infrastructure has little-to-no value. The only value is in your 'secret sauce', which could be a trademarked algorithm, proprietary data, an excellent marketing strategy, or something else, but it sure isn't your generic codebase! By making your code open source, you can immediately unlock the power of open source communities, and give back to the open source developers you rely on.
1. As genAI gets cheaper, outsourcing code generation to international developers will be a thing of the past. However, until we reach AGI (if ever), the creativity and innovation of the collective 'hive mind' will not be replaceable. This means that open-source communities will only grow in value. Whether that's finding bugs ([given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law)) and squashing bugs, or suggesting and implementing new features, communities will keep software together.

## üî≠ Our 2035 vision

All new software companies will be open core.

1 out of 4 existing software companies will open source at least part of their code base.

## ü¶∏ Why Codort?

Despite the increase in open-source software, it's still difficult to manage compliance and legal requirements.
Moreover, an increase in attacks from nation-state actors and even self-inflicted attacks from open-source maintainers, means that companies are more wary of their open-source dependencies.
New platforms are helping open-source consumers protect their software supply chain, but who is protecting the open-source producers?
Codort automates compliance management, making it easy to produce trustworthy commercial open source software.

## üß∞ Features

The features below are our (non-exhaustive) wishlist of products and features, some will happen, some won't, we'll be lean about it.
Anything deployed in the core distribution will always and forever be licenced under a permissive licence.
Enterprise features will be available for free to non-profit OSS.


1. User management
    1. ENTERPRISE: Fine-grained control over who can contribute to your SCM organisation
    1. ENTERPRISE: Fine-grained control over who can edit compliance documentation
1. Compliance
    1. Policies defined and maintained in Codort, preventing accidental edits or deletion in your SCM
    2. ENTERPRISE: Policies synced across all repositories within your organisation to prevent accidental conflicts in licensing and more
    3. Template repositories for licenses, NOTICE files, code of conducts, contribution guidelines, and more
    4. ENTERPRISE: Unified handling of external IP including developer certificate of origins and contributor licence agreements
    5. Documentation store for policies and compliance procedures with automated checking and review reminders
    6. ENTERPRISE: OpenChain compliance support with everything required to get your ISO5230 and ISO18974 (we hope to be certified as third-party auditors soon!)
1. Security
    1. Bring all your security platforms into one place through Codort: BlackDuck, FOSSA, Mend, etc.
1. Community management
    1. Plan and automate bounties for issue tracking, bug finding and squashing, and hackathons
    2. Abstract your community from your main issue tracker and pull/merge requests through our 'shop window' interface. Pull your issues, suggested code, documentation, and more from any provider into a single unified space. Automate issue triage before it bloats your repo!
    3. Generate and analyse community metrics including CHAOSS metrics. Integrate with GrimoireLab, Augur, Slack, Discord, and other platorms.
    4. ENTERPRISE: Advanced community metrics to help separate passive users from active contributors who could become maintainers.
    5. ENTERPRISE: AI agents for community management. Automate common FAQs through a community chatbot.
    6. Organise and run events through a single interface, combine Eventbrite with Zoom/Google Meet/Slack and your communication platform of choice for an easy way to manage any events. Generate metrics on attendance to learn more about your growing community. 
1. Revenue generation
    1. Manage all your sponsorship platforms in one place including GitHub Sponsors, Polar, Tidelift, Patreon and more.
    2. ENTERPRISE: Managed hosting for your COSS solution
    3. ENTERPRISE: Clean separation of open-source and proprietary code
    4. ENTERPRISE: Time tracking and other features to manage external consulting and training programmes
